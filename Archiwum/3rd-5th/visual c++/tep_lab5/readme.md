###This project has a compilation error in it on an operator overloading level. If anyone could work out a solution, I'd be grateful.

This project is about creating static and dynamic trees, the structure is as follows: CTree->CNode;
We can do some operations here, the most impressive of which is transfering the subtree to another tree.
Looks cool and took me about 8 hours

There's only one thing that stops it from having full functionality and it's operator overloading which I suck at.
